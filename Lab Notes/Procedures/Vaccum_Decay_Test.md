# Vaccum Decay Test Procedure

## General Guidelines
* For small tests used to qualitatively assume the performance of the chamber, use a small depressurization time (~2min).
* Pfieffer vacuum gauge is electro-resistive, thus tests involving alchohol to determine leaks will display a dip in pressure rather than a spike.
* To test the chamber decay versus the gauge-system isolate the both using the middle valve connecting both, leave for some time, and determine derivatives using jump in pressure value upon reconnecting the two.
* Re-apply vacuum grease to end caps as needed.
* If pump inlet is left in vacuum oil will rise through the tube, quickly cycle the pump with the inlet and outlet exposed to the atmosphere and the oil will decrease.
* Only read pump oil levels during operation.

## Procedure
1. Insert connection cable into vacuum gauge and computer, run reading script and optionally continous plotting script.
2. Close inlet valve with the funnel attached.
3. Ensure that the exhaust and inlet tubes to the vacuum pump are unobstructed and are not collapsed.
4. Turn on vacuum pump. After ~5 minutes of operation cycle valves connected to the gauge and pump to remove trapped air. Continue to run for a minimum of one hour.
    * Gurguling sound is expected for the first couple seconds of pump activity, if it continues it is symptomatic of an open valve in the chamber.
    * Extended time is required to reach absolute vacuum; depressurization will occur inverse exponentially.
5. After vacuum has been reached shut the valve connecting to the pump, then shut off the pump.
6. Keep reading values as long as requried. To shutdown test re-pressurize the chamber via the CO inlet valve, then re-open the valve leading to the pump.
7. Store the CSV values of pressure and clean accordingly.
