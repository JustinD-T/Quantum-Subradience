## Current State
* Disassembled chamber to clean and finalze all PTFE connections
* Leakage rates are improved, but still about 1 magnitude lower than required.
## Changes
* Trying to disassemble again and re-do PTFE, improving on last time by not over-tightening connections.
* Running final vacuum tests with the current setup before redesigning the chamber.

## Results
* After cleaning and re-installing, results are astronomically worse. Full chamber is recompressing at a rate of ~4.5mbar/second
* Isolated chamber still performs well with minimal leakage, although with odd fluctuations. These could be the result of measurement error or outgassing.
* Maximum pressure is likely 3mbar with current faulty setup.

## Next Steps
* Full change in setup
    * The following codes: Quick-Clamp High-Vacuum Fitting for 1" OD Aluminum Tube x Butt-Weld Tube, 1-9/16" Long (5786N24)
    * On/Off Valve with Ultra-High-Vacuum Fittings Valve Trade Number 25, for 1" Tube OD (4123K45)
