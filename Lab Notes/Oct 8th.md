### Oct 8th

## General Notes
    - Connected new vaccum gauge and CO monitor to chamber
    - Vaccuum gauge connection is nominally good, although all vacuum is lost when connecting the CO monitor. Currenly investigating.
    - Pulled a vacuum with old pump and new gauge, nominally acceptable pressure gain
        -Old pump is able to pull until ~1.5 mBar
    -Ordered USB-mini cable for communication with vacuum pump
    -Established communication with wave analyzer


## To Do
    -Finish wave analyzer communication class/gui
    -Communicate with vacuum pump
    -Talk to Brian to find new CO monitor connection
