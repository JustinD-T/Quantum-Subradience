!!!! Include data write speed and file size

Goals:
    -Read pressure and spectrum
    -Set defaults to spectrum on start
    -Plot and record data visually

Plan:
    -Config.json
        -Contains defaults and ports etc
    -PressureReader.py
        -Will try to launch, will handle gracefully if not
    -SpectrumReader.py
        -Will try to launch, will handle gracefully if not
    -Visualizer.py 
        -Will show the pressure vs time, spectrum, and rolling avrg spectrum. Additional stats for decays
    -Master.py
        -General will run both with visualizer.
            -Can alternatively be run with -d (display) -p (pressure) -s (spectrum)
            -Will create new logs for each run
